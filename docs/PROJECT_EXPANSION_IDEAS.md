## Appendix: Detailed Idea Descriptions

### Why "Narrative Puzzle Mode" (3C) Scores Highest

This idea combines multiple winning factors:
- **Addresses a real gap**: Chess puzzles exist everywhere, but none tell stories
- **Perfect fit**: ChessAlive's core strength is narrative - puzzles are a natural canvas
- **Engagement loops**: Daily puzzles create retention habits
- **Monetization**: Puzzle packs can be sold, subscription for unlimited
- **Shareability**: "I solved today's ChessAlive puzzle!" is highly shareable
- **Accessibility**: Doesn't require a full game commitment

### Why "AI Game Stories" (8C) Ties for Top

- **Low implementation cost**: Already have LLM integration
- **High "magic" factor**: Transforming your game into an epic tale is delightful
- **Shareability**: Generated stories are perfect for social media
- **Unique**: No chess platform does this
- **Builds on strength**: Extends the narrative focus rather than diluting it
